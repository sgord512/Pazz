Okay, so I want to make a command-line app that allows me to keep track of my thoughts about albums, songs, artists, and quickly see them listed in a variety of different formats.

So I want to be able to specify a song, and if it is in the database, add a note to it. 

Let's call it the app "pazz" for the time being.

Here are some usages:

pazz note "Absolutely Bill's Mood" moody, dramatic, another classic on TMBG's eponymous album. Interesting rythmically. The back end of this album needs more love.

pazz note -overwrite "Absolutely Bill's Mood" moody, dramatic, another classic on TMBG's eponymous album. Interesting rythmically. The back end of this album needs more love.
pazz note -o "Absolutely Bill's Mood" moody, dramatic, another classic on TMBG's eponymous album. Interesting rythmically. The back end of this album needs more love.

So the possibilities for the above line are: the song is found, and the new note is printed.
       		     	     	   	     the song is not found, and it cannot be created. Error message, and you try again.
					     other errors.

commands:

note: add a note (can be artist, song, album)
song: shortcut for adding song. If already there, then append.
album: shortcut for adding album. If already there, then append.
artist: shortcut for adding artist. If already there, then append.
albums: lists all albums you have chosen. Can be short or verbose.
songs: lists all songs you have chosen. Can be short or verbose.
artists: lists all artists that you have chosen. Can be short or verbose.
